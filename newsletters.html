<h1>Thoda gyaan on passion,profession and much more</h1>
<p>I am not sure which person internally knows what he or she wants to be. It is the environment that a child gets while growing up what he or she should do. There are many entrepreneurs who were inspired by the movie social network and a book by Rashmi bansal:-Arise, awake. There are many experiences that inspire a person to choose a specific profession, standup comic Samay Raina has often said that he was bullied in school and to gain validation he got into comedy and jokes. There are objects and things that are around us that inspire us to choose the profession, many journalists today got the inspiration of becoming a presenter by watching DD news.
    This is not all, there are many people who don’t find any inspiration while growing up and who don’t go through any experiences that inspire them in choosing their profession. If you fall in this category then there is nothing wrong with you what you can do is be more curious and know a little bit about
     everything. </p>
